Instructions for the secondary boot loader (you usually don't need to upgrade the primary, and it's dangerous):

With heimdall (in download mode):

# heimdall flash --secondary-boot-backup Sbl.bin

With odin (in download mode):

- Select Sbl.bin.tar
- Check Phone Bootloader Update
- Click start

The XWJM2 version is currently recommended for CM7.

For your safety, the primary boot loader is not provided as tar - if you can tar it properly, maybe you actually know what you're doing, even if the chance is still slim... :P
